# Machine Feature Pricing Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehensive machine feature pricing functionality to the price_master.php system. Users can now set individual prices for machine features in addition to base machine pricing.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Database Table
**File:** `machine_feature_prices_table.sql`
- Creates `machine_feature_prices` table for storing feature pricing
- Includes foreign key constraints and unique indexes
- Prevents overlapping date ranges for same machine feature

### 2. AJAX Endpoints
**File:** `ajax/get_machine_features_for_pricing.php`
- Fetches available features for a selected machine
- Returns JSON response with feature list

**File:** `ajax/get_feature_prices.php`
- Fetches existing feature prices for a machine
- Includes pricing status (active, future, expired)

### 3. Main Application
**File:** `price_master.php` (Modified)
- Added feature price creation/deletion handlers
- Added feature pricing forms and UI sections
- Integrated with existing machine pricing workflow

**File:** `js/price_master.js` (Modified)
- Added global variables for feature pricing state
- Updated reset form functionality
- Added feature pricing support

## Key Features

### ✅ Machine Feature Pricing
- **Feature Selection**: When a machine is selected, users can add pricing for individual features
- **Price Management**: Separate pricing for each feature with validity periods
- **Overlap Prevention**: System prevents overlapping date ranges for same feature
- **Status Tracking**: Shows active, future, or expired status for feature prices

### ✅ User Interface
- **Dynamic Layout**: Feature pricing forms appear when machine is selected
- **Grid Adjustment**: Layout automatically adjusts from 2-column to 3-column when feature pricing is active
- **Feature Loading**: Automatically loads available features for selected machine
- **Price Display**: Shows existing feature prices with status indicators

### ✅ Data Validation
- **Date Range Validation**: Ensures valid_from < valid_to
- **Price Validation**: Ensures positive pricing values
- **Overlap Detection**: Prevents duplicate pricing for same feature/date range
- **Required Fields**: All fields required for proper data integrity

### ✅ Permission Integration
- Uses existing permission system (`price_master` permissions)
- Create, edit, delete permissions respected for feature pricing
- Consistent with existing price master security model

## Workflow

1. **Select Machine**: User selects a machine from dropdown
2. **Show Feature Button**: "Add Feature Pricing" button appears
3. **Feature Form**: Click button to reveal feature pricing form
4. **Feature Selection**: System loads available features for the machine
5. **Price Entry**: User enters price and validity dates for selected feature
6. **Save & Display**: Feature price is saved and displayed in feature prices list
7. **Management**: Users can view/delete existing feature prices

## Database Schema

```sql
machine_feature_prices (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    machine_id INT NOT NULL,
    feature_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
    valid_from DATE NOT NULL,
    valid_to DATE NOT NULL,
    is_active TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    FOREIGN KEY (machine_id) REFERENCES machines(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_machine_feature_date (machine_id, feature_name, valid_from, valid_to)
)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- **jQuery Integration**: Fully integrated with existing jQuery-based UI
- **AJAX Loading**: Dynamic feature loading and price management
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains Bootstrap responsive layout
- **Form Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation

### Backend
- **PHP Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing PHP architecture
- **Database Constraints**: Proper foreign keys and unique constraints
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Security**: Input sanitization and permission checking

## Benefits

1. **Granular Pricing**: Individual pricing for each machine feature
2. **Time-based Pricing**: Support for different pricing periods
3. **Data Integrity**: Prevents pricing conflicts and overlaps
4. **User Experience**: Intuitive interface integrated with existing workflow
5. **Scalability**: Supports unlimited features per machine
6. **Reporting Ready**: Structured data for pricing reports and analysis

## Next Steps

1. **Database Creation**: Run the SQL script to create the feature pricing table
2. **Testing**: Test feature pricing functionality with sample data
3. **User Training**: Train users on the new feature pricing capabilities
4. **Reporting**: Optionally add feature pricing to reports and quotations

## Notes

- Feature pricing is separate from base machine pricing
- Features must exist in `machine_features` table before pricing can be added
- System maintains full audit trail with created_at/updated_at timestamps
- Integration maintains compatibility with existing price master functionality
